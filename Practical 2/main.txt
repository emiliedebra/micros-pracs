after set = 22 cycles
each loop = 5 cycles
1 second = 8 000 000 cycles so 8000000-22 (for checks) = 7999978 divided by 5 (for loop) = roughly
plus 22 (add 22 again)
overall: 0x186A11 (roughly 1 600 000)

0.4 seconds = 8000000*0.4 = 3200000 - 11 = 3199988 + 18 = 320006/5 = 0x9C401
0.3 seconds = 8000000*0.3 = 2400000 - 17 - 2399983 + 30 = 2400013/5 = 0x75302

0.4s = 8000000*0.4-8 = 3200000-8+18 = 3200010/5 = 640002
0.3s = 8000000*0.3-16+13/5= 479999


8000000 - 23 = 7999977/5 + 23 = 1600018 = 0x186A12
0.4s = 8000000*0.4-14-13/5+13 = 640021 = 0x9C415
0.3s = 8000000*0.3-12/5+5 = 480002 =  0x75302
